Traveling on a foreign subway
I felt tired that day
Boxing Day
I didn't feel like fighting
All the saddest things from my mind
At the lowest end
Walked up to the pavement
Met the sky
Under which I'd meet you
Well, I didn't think it was worth it
You showed me what I was missing
Feelings I'd left behind
Now that we're together
I'll never want anything different
Peaceful hearts and minds
